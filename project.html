<h2 align="center">A Description of Privacy and Digital Security Today</h2>
<p>Technology is changing and developing everyday and it has changed our world economically, politically and socially especially after the development and innovation in the internet services. Today, a person can be connected to the whole world with just one search and a person can find almost everything about another person through the use of internet. However, the information that internet hold about almost every person in this world can get in wrong hands and people can misuse the information without leaving a trace. Hence, for solving issues with personal information there are some basic guidelines that one must follow to get rid of issues related to online crimes. The online information is not only meant to use in bad ways but information is used in a good way for most of the time. Information can be used in encouraging businesses, finding and tracking criminals and criminal activities, and in this pandemic working from home and studying from home. Information and digital security can be described as useful in  global communication, helping police and economic development.</p>
<p>Information and digital security have given grounds for the global interaction of people. Today, we can meet new people from different countries and make them friends. Social sites like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. has given access to people to come out of their regions to the global platform. Different cultures throughout different countries and regions are shared with each other and people came to a point of global community. The small information of people written on their social media platforms can be accessed according to the privacy options in these platforms by the users. Companies makes sure that no one is digitally assaulted or harassed and no culture is targeted through digital media as users can report the inappropriate contents. Issues like criminal activities throughout every corner or the world and protests against the oppressing policies and governments have acquired a great platform where people can discuss and put pressure globally on governments to solve the problems of people. For instance, Farmers protest in India started from small villages and today almost every country and nearly every person is talking about these protests to support farmers in India which has pressurized the Indian government for its policies.</p><p>
The use of digital security includes tracking and tapping criminal activities and stopping them. Cameras which include face recognition systems, tracking criminals through GPS, and tapping their phones have given a break to criminal activities throughout the Globe. Today, criminals cannot just run after doing some kind of crime because they can be tracked with the help of cameras, phones, and they can be found through the information that they have online through various sources. Tundis and others says that "Security agencies are turning towards Information Technology (IT) , as well as by improving the intelligence
systems through the collection of data, to solve cases and reduce the crime rate or even capture
criminals" (pg. 2). However, there is a new type of crime which has came up because of internet and the information on it which is called the cyber crime which includes use of information online for cyberbullying, cybertheft of money in different ways, identity theft. But this lead to a new type of police that deals with these crimes known as cyberpolice. This police uses IP addresses, white hack hackers who use legal ways to find the culprits and take them down. There is a use of malwares like trojan, rootkit attacks, backdoors, etc. but these can be taken care with the help of antivirus softwares like Norton, McAfee, etc. and firewall which protects users from these kinds of attacks.</p><p>
Digital security and privacy regulations are best given by OECD (Economic Cooperation and Development). OECD gives eight privacy principles which are Limited Collection, purpose, quality, use limitation, security, openness, participation and accountability. These eight principles are designed in such a way which ensures the credibility of the information, informant, and the person getting the information and the purpose for acquiring information. These principles are closely followed by the online businesses to promote their business and reach new customers. I myself worked with Telus marketing and sales department where we use online information in form of making more sales. Similarly, almost all telecommunication companies target new and old customer through the information that they have on their files and also the system ensures that the agents do not misuse customer’s information with the help of encryption of data and secured passwords. Encryption is kind of algorithm which changes the original information with another form with the use of different algorithms so that information cannot be misused while it is transferred or reaches to a unknown or an unauthorized user. Online marketing can be used by giving reward to the users when the refer an email to their friends (Rowley pg. 53)
</p><p>in conclusion, Privacy and digital security makes sure that social, economic and political relations of people which happened because of online information. We are living in a digital community today and nothing is safe online but to make sure that we just have to do some basic things like acquiring different passwords, reading terms and conditions, etc. that makes sure that our online information is safe.</p><h2>Works Cited:</h2>
