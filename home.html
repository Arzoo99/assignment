<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Arzoo. I was born in a small city of Punjab Sri Muktsar Sahib. My father is the manager in Stock Exchange and my mother was a teacher and owns a parlor. I went to Bhai Mastan Singh Public School for my high school and after that I moved to Canada and Columbia college for my Associates.  </p>
<h2>Life in Canada</h2>
<p>My life in Canada did not started on a good note. I felt alone all the time just like any other international student and I was strugling with part time work as well as ith my studies. Actually, I want to go for pilot school after my associates and for now I just wanna complete my study in Columbia college.</p>
